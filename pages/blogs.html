            <h2>What is the difference between Arrow Function and Regular Function</h2>
            <p>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more
                concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow
                functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.such as:
                1. Syntax
                2. Arguments binding
                3. this
                4. new keyword
                5. No duplicate named parameters
                6. Function Hoisting
                7. Methods</p>

            <h2>Why We using Template String</h2>
            <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older
                versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
                Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and
                the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting strings to different
                entities.</p>

            <h2>What are the differences between map foreach filter find</h2>
            <p>.forEach:

                .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array
                and it returns undefined.</p>
            <p>.map():
                .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                elements.</p>

            <p>.filter():
                .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
                with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
            <p>.find():
                .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.</p>
